      <p class="lyric">
I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead
I got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath
Cold sweet death, one last caress
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath
Cold sweet death, one last caress
I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath
Cold sweet death, one last caress
Last caress today, yo-o-o-oh, yooo-oh
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
We're gonna burn in hell - Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there - Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell, green hell
Throw your fuckin' friends inside - Green hell, green hell
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay - Green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell, green hell
Gotta burn it all, green hell
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is your world that ended
Touch it, feel it, green hell
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring green hell, green hell
