[Light In The Black]

[Intro]

[Tarot Woman]

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no
No, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines that set my hand
Go, go, go

Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
Mine, mine, mine
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
Fly, fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

[Stargazer]

High noon, oh, I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breaking my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, he's lighter than air


Oh, I see his face
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
And when do we leave?
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But we don't know why
Now, where do we go?

[Kill The King]
Yeah

Danger, danger, the queen's about to kill
Stranger, stranger, and life's about to spill
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
No pawn, be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah, strike him down


Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
No pawn, be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king

Strike him down

Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
No pawn, be gone, speed on and on


Kill the king
Yeah, tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah, take his crown
Oh, kill the king
Go take his crown
Yeah, yeah
Kill the king
Strike him down
