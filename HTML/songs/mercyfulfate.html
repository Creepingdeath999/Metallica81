<p class="ride-par">სიმღერა არის უგრძესი ნაწარმოები რაც კი ოდესმე მეტალიკას ჩაუწერია (11:10), თუმცა არა ყველაზე გრძელი, რომელიც შეიცავს მეტალიკას ორიგინალ მასალას, ასეთი არის <a class="garage-a" href="redemption.html">Suicide & Redemption</a> (9:59).</p>








          <h1 style="margin-top: 200px;">სიმღერის ტექსტი:</h1>
      <p class="lyric">
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed if not it's Satan's fall
Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill (for the kill)
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry
And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind
