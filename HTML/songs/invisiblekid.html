<p class="ride-par">  Invisible Kid არის მეხუთე სიმღერა ალბომიდან და ის ეხება ბავშვს, რომელსაც არასათანადოდ ეპყრობოდნენ, ყოველთვის ასწავლიდნენ ყველასაგან თავის არიდებას, რაც მას სასოწარკვეთილს ხდიდა. რაც ნათლად ჩანს შემდეგ მონაკვეთში:<i style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
                                           "Ooh, what a good boy you are.
                                           Out of the way and you kept to yourself.
                                           Ooh, can't you see that he's not here?"</i></p>
   <p class="ride-par">ასევე, ტექსტი ეხება ისეთ ხალხს, რომელიც თავის გონებაშია გამოკეტილი და თავის სირცხვილს და ტკივილს იქ მალავს:<i style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
                                          "Locked away in his brain.
                                           From the shame and the pain.
                                           World down the drain."</i>

      <p class="lyric">
Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid
Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown
Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain
Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much
I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside
But I'll show you...
I'm ok, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm ok, just go away
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now (x2)

Oooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Oooh, can't you see that he's not here?
He doesn't want the attention you give
Oooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid, floats alone in his room
Oooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself
Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain
Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much
I hide inside
I hurt inside

Into distance let me fade
I'm ok, just go away
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far
Open your heart

Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now (x2)
